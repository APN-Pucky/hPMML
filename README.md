# High-Performance PMML Scoring

*hPMML* is C++ library for scoring machine learning models serialized with the Predictive Model Markup Language ([PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4/GeneralStructure.html)).
It exposes a minimalist and user-friendly API and it targets high performance in model scoring, keeping a predictable and minimal memory footprint.

Currently, the following PMML elements are supported:
* PMML General structure (preprocessing, data dictionary, etc.)
* Tree-based models
* Regression models
* Ensembles of the previous

## Getting Started

```cpp
#include "hPMML.h"

hpmml::Model model("IrisTree.xml");
std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> sample = {
	{"sepal_length","6.6"},
	{"sepal_width","2.9"},
	{"petal_length","4.6"},
	{"petal_width","1.3"}
};

std::cout << model.predict(sample); // "Iris-versicolor"
```
